# MAP AND FILTER

     both methods let us process all the items in an array .
    
     Filter - helps to filter the array .
     Map = to apply some kind of operations on the array we want.

## MAP 
    - calls function on each item in an array to create a new array .

## FILTER
    - calls a true or false function on each item and creates a new array with only the items where the 
    function returns true .



## SPREAD(...)
    - another neat trick for iterating arrays .
    - it lets us take all the items in an array and spread 'em around.
