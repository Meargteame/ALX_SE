# DATA FETCHING AND PROMISES

    - ULRs point to resources on the web 
    - API's provide URLs that point at data we care about .
    - endpoint of an API 
    - fetch() - lets us use js to load data from API's(URL)
# PROMISES
    - Promise is as it is named just a promise
    -  Promises can be in 3 possible states .
    - pending : still waiting for the value.
    - fullfilled : ("AKA RESOLVED") - : finally got the value, all done .
    - rejected :sorry couldn't get the value , all done .
    => It takes time for promises to resolve , so they are "Asynchronus"

    - await - lets us tell js to stop and await for an asynchronos operation to finish .
    - In the case of a promise, it waits for it to resolve , before continuing with our code .
    - The Response Body - Contains data we care about .
    - But we have to read the data somehow.
